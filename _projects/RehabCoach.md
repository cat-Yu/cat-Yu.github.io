**Problem:**

For rehabilitation, clinical tests require direct, visual observation of patient's exercises, but:

* tests are time-consuming
* therapists have limited availabilities

The adoption of rehabilitation monitoring system remains a challenge due to:

* the lack of user-centered designs
* opaqueness of the machine learning algorithms

**Solution:**

Virtual Coach for patients with musculoskeletal and neurological diseases, that:
* identifies the compensations
* provide feedback & corrections
