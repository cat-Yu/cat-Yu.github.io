CLOCK (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) or Clock is a gene encoding a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS transcription factor that is believed to affect both the persistence and period of circadian rhythms.
Research shows that the CLOCK gene plays a major role as an activator of downstream elements in the pathway critical to the generation of circadian rhythms.
The inidividual class project(60-496 Activated Anamorphs:Performative Inhabitables and Interactive Prostheses) was to remember Spring 2021: I was living in China, attending live lectures in the U.S., and consistenly living in a timezone somewhere in Europe. I was constantly concernd with my health, and this project gave me the oppurtunity to explore circadian cycles.
