After some preliminary research and advised by Professor Robert Heard, I wanted to explore conductivities in bioplastic yarn. I found a [sodium alginate bioplastic yarn recipe](https://www.instructables.com/Create-Bio-yarn/) and a [conductive bioplastic recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn5bkwJZKpw) and was trying to play with bioplastic materials to make conductive yarn.
