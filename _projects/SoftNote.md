In this project we explore gesture detection in connection to resistive stretch sensing. Specifically, our project is motivated by the piano learning experience for people with visual impairments as it is hard for them to keep track of fingerings when practicing. Beyond piano learning, our approach also fits into the larger picture of hand gesture detection as it detects finger tapping and movements.
